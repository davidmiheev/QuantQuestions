        "> Adam is rolling a fair 10−sided die. He gets to roll repeatedly and may decide when to stop at any time. If he obtains a value that is not 10 on each roll, he adds the upface to his total monetary sum. If he rolls a 10, he loses all of his money. If Adam plays optimally, he should stop once he has at least $k total. Find k\n",
