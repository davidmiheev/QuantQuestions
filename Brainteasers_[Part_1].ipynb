        "2. All pirates vote on the proposal, including the pirate that made the proposal. If 50% or more of the pirates accept the proposal, the coins are distributed as proposed.\n",

        "3. Three pirates left (Pirates 1, 2, and 3): Pirate 3 needs one vote in addition to his own. Understanding Pirate 1 gets nothing if Pirate 3 is thrown overboard, Pirate 3 offers 1 coin to Pirate 1 and keeps 99. This secures Pirate 1's vote. Pirate 2 gets nothing.\n",
        "4. Four pirates left (Pirates 1, 2, 3, and 4): Pirate 4, needing one vote in addition to his own, knows Pirate 2 gets nothing if Pirate 4 is thrown overboard. By offering 1 coin to Pirate 2 and keeping 99 for himself, Pirate 4 secures Pirate 2's vote. Pirates 1 and 3 get nothing.\n",
        "5. Five pirates left (Pirates 1 through 5): Pirate 5 needs two votes in addition to his own. By offering 1 coin to Pirates 1 and 3 — who get nothing if Pirate 5 is ousted — and keeping 98 coins, Pirate 5 ensures a majority. Pirates 2 and 4 will get nothing in this proposal, but they can't change the outcome since pirate 5 has already secured a majority.\n",
